        Bidar is a city in the north-eastern part of Karnataka state in India. It is the headquarters of Bidar district
        which borders Maharashtra and Telangana. It is a rapidly urbanising city in the wider Bidar Metropolitan area.
        The city is well known for its many sites of architectural, historical and religious importance.

        Being located at the farthest of around 700 km (430 mi) from the state capital Bangalore, it has been neglected
        by the state government for a long time. However, owing to its rich heritage, the city has a prominent place on
        the Archaeological Map of India. Picturesquely perched on the Deccan plateau, the Bidar fort is more than 500
        years old and still standing strong.[7] According to the book "Bidar Heritage" published by the state Department
        of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage, of the 61 monuments listed by the department, about 30 are tombs located
        in and around Bidar city.,[8] explaining its nickname, "City of Whispering Monuments". The heritage sites in and
        around Bidar have become the major attraction for film shooting in recent years with Bollywood making visits
        apart from kannada film industry[9]

        Bidar is home for the second biggest Indian Air Force training centre in the country. The IAF Station Bidar is
        used for advanced jet training of prospective fighter pilots on BAe Hawk aircraft.[10]
