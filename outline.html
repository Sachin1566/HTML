    Bidar
    Etymology
   <p class="outline"> The name of Bidar appears to be derived from ‘bidiru’ which means bamboo.[12]

    Legend has associated Bidar with the ancient kingdom of Vidarbha, to which references are found in early Hindu
    literature like Malavikagnimitra, Mahabharata, the Harivamsa, Bhagavata, and a few other Puranas.[13]: 3  Its
    association can be seen apparently on account of the similarity in names Bidar and Vidarbha. This has been mentioned
    in Firishta's writings.

    The traditional tales reveal that Vidura lived here; hence the place was earlier called Viduranagara and also as the
    place where Nala and Damayanti (Daughter of Raja Bhima, the King of Vidharba) were meeting.[14]

    Bidar under the rule of the Bahmani Sultanate was known as Muhammadabad.

    History
    Main article: History of Bidar
    The recorded History of the city goes back to the third century B.C. when it was a part of the Mauryan Empire. After
    the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Kadambasand Chalukyas of Badami and later the Rashtrakutas reigned over Bidar territory.
    The Chalukyas of Kalyana and Kalachuris of Kalyanis also regained the area. For a short period after Kalyani
    Chalukyas the area of Bidar was under the Seunas of Devagiri and Kakatiyas of Warangal.
